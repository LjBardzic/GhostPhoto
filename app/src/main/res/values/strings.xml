        Ghost Photo is an app that takes photos on its own in a regular interval. It\'s like a ghost
        that photographs you.\n
        \n
        If you want to take a selfie, the back facing camera makes higher quality photos. Putting
        the camera down instead of holding it steps up the photo quality another notch. But how do
        you trigger the photos then? A timer takes one photo. With Ghost Photo, you can make the
        phone take a series of photos while you post. At the end, simply look through the photos
        and pick the best one.\n\nWhen taking a group photo, there is often a runner. The runner
        presses the timer button and runs to the group. Some smart people simply turn on a video
        and screen grab the perfect shot out of it. The problem is that the camera can make higher
        quality photos for still shots than ongoing video. So, Photo Ghost comes to the rescue.
        It\'ll steadily snap photos at the highest still photo quality. You pick the best one and
        delete the rest.
